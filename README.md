dotfiles
========

Personal collection of configuation files for vim,screen,bash,readline,...

Only vim has its personal configuration directory.

For vim you need to install pathogen first:
mkdir -p ~/.vim/autoload ~/.vim/bundle; \
curl -Sso ~/.vim/autoload/pathogen.vim \
    https://raw.github.com/tpope/vim-pathogen/master/autoload/pathogen.vim

Enjoy! :)
