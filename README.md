Personal collection of configuation files for vim,screen,bash,readline,...

Only vim has its personal configuration directory.

## Vim quick start

1. Set up [Vundle]:

   ```
   $ git clone https://github.com/gmarik/vundle.git ~/.vim/bundle/vundle
   ```
3. Install configured bundles:

Launch `vim`, run `:BundleInstall` 
(or `vim +BundleInstall +qall` for CLI lovers)

Enjoy! :)
